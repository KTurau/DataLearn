## 1.1: Analytics & DE in a Modern Enterprise 

Data is growing at an unprecedented rate. Organizations that are using data to uncover opportunities and are applying that knowledge to differentiate themselves are the ones leading into the future. There are 3 main groups of people who can benefit from BIZ operations: 

1. Shareholders; 

2. Employees; 

3. Customers.

The most important group - customers. "customer obsession" -- leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. 

Corporation exists to create Value. For customers - customer experience. For employees - work/life balance, salary. For owners - value maximization. With the help of accurate/accessible data they make decisions. The job of a Data Engineer is to make quality data available for fact-finding and data-driven decision. 

## 1.2: Analytics, what is it for? (: 

1. Income growth;
2. Costs reduction; 
3. New markets/products research
4. Compliance
5. Risks avoidance
BIZ realize that data holds the key to competitive advantage

## 1.3: Data Engineering MindMap

As data has grown, so has the field of data engineering.

1. Data Integration. ETL/ELT - extract, transform, load; 
2. Data Repositories: Data Warehouse(DW); Data Platform(DP); Data Lake(DL). DP = DL + DW; 
3. Cloud computing platforms; 
4. Batch (this is how ETL/ELT tool works) / Stream;
5. Business Intelligence;
6. SQL (Structured Query Language);
7. Programming Languages: Python, Scala, Java;
8. MPP (Massive Parallel Processing);
9. Big Data;
10. Spark...

## 1.4: Key Players in Data Ecosystem (Data Professionals)

Data Engineering is a team sport. No one pearson is expected to have all the knowledge, skills, and specializations required for the wide-ranging tasks covered within the scope of data engineering.

### Traditional category:
1. Data Analyst (translate data and numbers into plain language, so organizations can make desicions);
2. BI Analysts;
3. ETL/ELT Engineer;
4. DW Architect;
5. Data Modeler. 

### DE category:
1. Data Engineer (develop and maintain data architecture and make data available for business operations and analysis);
2. Big Data Engineer;
3. Cloud Data Engineer;
4. Data Platform Engineer.

### Data Science, IT:
1. Software Development Engineer;
2. Machine Learning Engineer;
3. Visual Engineer; 
4. Applied Scientist; 
5. Research Scientist.

### Advanced analytics category:
1. Data mining;
2. Data science (analyze data for actionable insights + create predictive models).

It's not uncommon for data professionals to start their career in one of the data roles and transition to another role within the data ecosystem by supplementing their skills.

## 1.5: Enterprise Data Environment

**Layers:**
1. `Collecting source data` - Data is available in a variety of structured/unstructured datasets. Pull a copy of the data from the original sources into a data repository. Extracting, integrating, and organizing data from disparate sources(Data acquisition from multiple sources. Data architecture from storing source data);

2. `Processing data` - Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data to make it usable(Distributed systems for processing data. Pipelines for extracting, transforming, and loading data. Solutions for safeguarding quality, privacy, and security of data. Performance optimization. Adherence to compliance guidelines);

3. `Storing data` - Raw data needs to get organized, cleaned up, optimized for access, and conform to compliances and standards enforced in the organization. Storing data for reliability and easy availability of data(Data stores for storage of processed data. Scalable systems. Ensuring data privacy, security, compliance, monitoring, backup, and recovery);

4. `Access data` - Business stakeholders, apps, programmers, analysts, and data science use cases all pulling data from the enterprise data repository. Making data available to users securely(APIs, services, and programs for retrieving data for end-users. User access through interfaces and dashboards. Checks and balances to ensure data security).
